# LD33

This is my entry for Ludum Dare 33.

Theme is: "You are the monster"

## Brainstorming

- okay like soldiers or something
	- can i even draw a soldier?

- berserkers, lycanthropes, whatever?

- maybe just literally you are a monster
	- grendel or some shit
	- maybe a game like rcr or early gta

- oh man a detective game where you are finding a monster/monsters
	- but you were the monster the whole time (spooky)
	- or you find the monsters and are not the monster but expose them and are a monster for doing that
		- i like it sort of but too involved to finish during ld probably

- a game from the perspective of an energy drink can (lol)

- a simulation game where you manage an energy drink company (actually kind of a good idea)

- dungeon manager

- alien abductions

- monsters vs people the rts
	- you're a werewolf or something and you eat the villigers and scouts and the like and when you do that they sometimes become monsters?
	- or maybe just an rts where you are monsters and you like build... dens to lure warriors in?
	- maybe simulation game more than rts?
